# Neural Machine Translation 

-- In progress -- 

This is an implementation of a batched recurrent neural network(RNN) in NumPy utilizing an encoder and decoder architecture used for the task of machine translation (ex: translating from a source language to a target language).

The purpose of the repo was to learn how RNNs can train in batches even though they have a sequential architecture, along with how the encoder-decoder architecture is(was) used for machine translation. Preprocessed data..
