# Neural Machine Translation 

-- In progress -- 

This is an implementation of a sequence to sequence batched recurrent neural network(RNN) with weight tying from the ground up, just utilizing the library NumPy. 

The purpose of the repo was to gain a deeper understanding of recurrent neural networks by implementing the architecture of a sequence to sequence model from scratch.
