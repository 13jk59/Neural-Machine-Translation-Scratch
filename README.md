# Neural Machine Translation 

-- In progress -- 

This is an implementation of a batched recurrent neural network(RNN) in NumPy utilizing an encoder and decoder architecture used for the task of machine translation. 

The purpose of the repo was to learn how RNNs can train in batches even though they have a sequential architecture, how masking works in RNNs, along with how the encoder-decoder architecture of the RNN is used for machine translation.
