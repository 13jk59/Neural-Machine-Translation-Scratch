# Neural Machine Translation 

-- In progress -- 

This is an implementation of a sequence to sequence batched recurrent neural network(RNN) from scratch, just utilizing the library NumPy. 

The purpose of the repo was to deepen my understanding of recurrent neural networks by implementing the architecture of a sequence to sequence model from scratch.
